						<h1>The Impact of Flyknit Technology</h1>
						<div class="blog-content-summary">
							<h4>
								A brief overview of the impact of Flyknit technology and how it
								revolutionised the footwear industry. Reducing waste, reducing
								weight and reducing production costs.
							</h4>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						Nike Flyknit is a digitally enhanced knitting process best known in
						its role in lightweight, formfitting and virtually seemless shoe
						uppers. The technology uses high-strength fibres to create
						lightweight uppers with targeted areas of support, stretch and
						breathability. Flyknit has not only been revolutionary to consumers
						but it has caused a significant reduction in waste throughout the
						footwear industry.
					</p>
					<p>
						The idea dates as far back as the ‘80s as Nike experimented with an
						ultra-light mesh sneaker - the Sock Racer. Initially working towards
						Flyknit due to the runners’ desire for trainers that had the
						qualities of a sock - a snug and supportive fit that is virtually
						unnoticed by the wearer.
					</p>
					<h2>Early adoption</h2>
					<p>
						Nike Free, a series of running shoes adored by runners worldwide,
						were the first shoes to whole-heartedly adopt Flyknit technology.
						Due to their intentional “bare-foot” design, the shoes offer
						enhanced foot flexibility, better balance and improved strength.
						Nike’s elite athletes are seen using the Free series for jogging and
						low-mileage track workouts.
					</p>
					<p>
						Flyknit was a perfect fit as they reduced weight and provided
						superior comfort over any alternative on the market. Especially as
						the modern technology that allows Nike to emphasize more support in
						certain areas of the shoe was in early development stages at the
						time. Making the Flyknit upper unsuitable for other sports shoes.
					</p>

					<h2>Impact</h2>
					<p>
						The Knit technology has transformed production within the footwear
						industry. Compared to cut and sew footwear, experts suggest that
						Flyknit construction has led to a 60% reduction in waste from each
						shoe. Prior to its development, offcuts from the upper portion of
						the shoe generated significant waste. Since 2012, the technology has
						reduced nearly 3.5 million pounds of waste.
					</p>
					<p>
						Despite the clear advancements, Nike has not stopped there. In the
						upper portion of some of their latest models, such as the Nike
						Flyknit Lunar1+, waste has been reduced by some 80% compared to
						traditional Nike running footwear.
					</p>
					<p>
						Flyknit technology contributed to Nike being awarded the title of
						'most innovative company of 2013' by Fast Company magazine.
